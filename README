What is it?
-----------

ruby-ldapserver is a lightweight, pure Ruby skeleton for implementing LDAP
server applications. It is intended primarily for when you wish to build a
gateway from LDAP queries into some other protocol or database; it does not
attempt to be a full implementation of the bizarre LDAP data model itself
(although you could build one using this as a frontend)

The Connection class handles incoming connections, decodes ASN1-formatted
LDAP requests, and creates an Operation object for each request. The
Operation object further parses the ASN1 request and invokes methods which
you override to perform useful work. Responses and exceptions are converted
back into ASN1 and returned to the client.

Since it's written entirely in Ruby, it benefits from Ruby's threading
engine. You should ensure that your operations handler is also thread-safe;
for example, you could allocate a pool of 10 Mysql handles, and borrow one
from the pool for each query that you wish to handle. The examples/
subdirectory includes some running examples you can use as a starting point.

Libraries
---------

ASN1 encoding and decoding is done using the 'openssl' extension, which is
standard in the Ruby 1.8.2 base distribution. However, I've found in the
past that Linux machines don't always build the openssl extension when
compiling Ruby from source. With Red Hat 9, the solution for me was, when
building Ruby itself:

    # export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/kerberos/include"
    # export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/kerberos/lib"
    # ./configure ...etc

Status
------

This is an initial alpha release. There are lots of missing features
including:
- filter support
- test suite (inc. abandon, concurrent threading, and performance tests)
- TLS/SSL support
- compare and modifyrdn

Feel free E-mail me with patches and suggestions for this software. However,
please DON'T send me any general questions about LDAP, how it works, how to
apply LDAP in your particular situation, or questions about any other LDAP
software. The `ldap@umich.edu` mailing list is probably the correct place to
ask such questions. See:
