Added examples/speedtest.rb

Added :nodelay option to tcpserver to set TCP_NODELAY socket option. This
removes 100ms of latency in responses.

20050618
Fix examples/rbslapd2.rb SQLPool so that it always puts connections back
into the pool (using 'ensure' this time :-)

Modify connection.rb to ensure no memory leak in the event of exceptions
being raised in operation threads.
